## Problem Statement:

I will build a regression model to predict fantasy points per game for MLB players in the current 2021 season.  RMSE will be used as the metric to evaluate performance.  

- Model will be trained on the past 2 years of MLB statistics
- Model will predict on truely unseen data, current stats for this year.
